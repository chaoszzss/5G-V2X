Qualcomm Technologies Inc MHI Bus controller

MHI control driver enables clients to communicate with external mode
using MHI protocol.

==============
Node Structure
==============

Main node properties:

- reg
  Usage: required
  Value type: Array (5-cell PCI resource) of <u32>
  Definition: First cell is devfn, which is determined by pci bus topology.
	Assign the other cells 0 since they are not used.

- qcom,smmu-cfg
  Usage: required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Required SMMU configuration bitmask for PCIe bus.
	BIT mask:
	BIT(0) : Attach address mapping to endpoint device
	BIT(1) : Set attribute S1_BYPASS
	BIT(2) : Set attribute FAST
	BIT(3) : Set attribute ATOMIC
	BIT(4) : Set attribute FORCE_COHERENT

- qcom,addr-win
  Usage: required if SMMU S1 translation is enabled
  Value type: Array of <u64>
  Definition: Pair of values describing iova start and stop address

- MHI bus settings
  Usage: required
  Values: as defined by mhi.txt
  Definition: Per definition of devicetree/bindings/bus/mhi.txt, define device
	specific MHI configuration parameters.

Example:
========
qcom,mhi {
	compatible = "qcom,mhi";
	qcom,pci-domain = <0>;
	qcom,pci-bus = <1>;
	qcom,pci-slot = <0>;
	qcom,smmu-cfg = <0x3d>;
	qcom,addr-win = <0x0 0x20000000 0x0 0x3fffffff>;

	<mhi bus configurations>
